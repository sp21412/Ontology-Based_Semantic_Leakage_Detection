# README.md content for Ontology-Based CoT Step Validator

# Ontology-Based CoT Step Validator (Prototype)

# This is an early-stage prototype pipeline designed to explore step-level validation of 
# Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language model outputs. 
# The goal is to identify semantic leakageâ€”off-topic or invalid reasoning stepsâ€”by using 
# a combination of lexical resources like WordNet and linguistic processing tools like spaCy.

# This version does NOT use formal ontologies like ConceptNet, UMLS, or constraint logic.
# It also lacks structured concept matching or graph reasoning. 
# It is an initial proof-of-concept.

# ðŸ”§ File Overview
# -----------------------------------------------------

# load_data.py
# - Loads and prints the first example from the Deltabench_v1.jsonl dataset.
# - Helps verify that the dataset is readable and correctly structured.

# label_examples.py
# - Selects the first 10 examples from the dataset (ignores correctness or labels).
# - Saves them to a file called examples_for_labeling.json for further processing.

# examples_for_labeling.json
# - A static file containing 10 selected examples from the DeltaBench dataset.
# - Used as input for the ontology checking step.

# ontology_check.py
# - Parses each CoT explanation using spaCy for sentence and POS-level analysis.
# - Extracts nouns and verbs, and checks if each token exists in WordNet.
# - Flags reasoning steps that include tokens NOT found in WordNet, 
#   assuming these may reflect semantic drift or unfamiliar concepts.
# - Outputs a CSV file flagged_cot_steps.csv summarizing flagged reasoning steps and their unknown tokens.

# -----------------------------------------------------
# Output
# -----------------------------------------------------

# flagged_cot_steps.csv
# - A CSV report of all 10 CoTs, listing:
#   - The original question
#   - The full CoT reasoning
#   - Steps containing unknown terms
#   - Optional human drift labels (if present)

# -----------------------------------------------------
# Requirements
# -----------------------------------------------------

# Install the following dependencies:

# pip install spacy nltk pandas
# python -m nltk.downloader wordnet
# python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# -----------------------------------------------------
# Known Limitations
# -----------------------------------------------------

# - No structured ontology mapping: Only WordNet is used, and only as a basic lexical checker.
# - No relationship checking: Doesn't validate concept relationships or type constraints.
# - Overflags: May incorrectly flag technical or domain-specific terms not in WordNet.
# - No real semantic coherence check â€” this is closer to a vocabulary filter.

# -----------------------------------------------------
# Future Improvements
# -----------------------------------------------------

# - Replace WordNet with richer ontologies (ConceptNet, UMLS, etc.).
# - Add ontology-based relation and type constraint checking.
# - Use sentence-level embeddings or NLI tools to score internal step coherence.
# - Introduce visualization of CoT structure and flagged errors.
